# 👟 Fake Shoe Detection Web App

A deep learning–powered web application that detects whether a shoe is **real** or **fake** using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.  
The app is built with **Streamlit** and uses a pre-trained model file (`shoe_model_v2.keras`) to make predictions directly from uploaded images.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Deep Learning Model** — Trained CNN model for image classification  
- 🖼️ **Image Upload Interface** — Upload `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` files  
- ⚡ **Instant Predictions** — Displays whether the shoe is *Real* or *Fake*  
- 🌐 **Streamlit Web App** — Simple, interactive, and lightweight UI  
- 🔁 **Reusable Model** — Works with any binary image classification model
